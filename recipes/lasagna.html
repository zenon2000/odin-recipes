    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, 
        he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time,
         World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular 
         lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly 
        passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life and legacy here.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>· Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet 
            Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>· Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves 
            of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>· Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, 
            two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>· Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle 
            sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>· Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored 
            with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, 
            fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>· Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>· Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and 
            ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>· Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta 
            so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>2. Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, 
            and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>3. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 
            1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
             in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>5. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
            remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>7. To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
            baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella 
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 
            1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>8. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray 
            or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and 
            bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>10. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
